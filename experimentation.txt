Experimentation with convolution:

1)

NOTE:
First I converted squares.png to an rgb color space in Photoshop (c) <- gotta include that lol

experiment: squares.png with bell9.filt
output:     squares_bell9.png
result:     I noticed that this filter blurred the edges of the square very evenly

experiment: squares.png with box9.filt
output:     squares_box9.png
result:     This filter blurred the edges of the square with less of even of a blur.
            The corners of the square had a triangular artifact where it looked like
            the blur was overlapping of the two adjacent sides.

experiment: squares.png with tent9.filt
output:     squares_tent9.png
result:     This filter was very similar to the bell filter. There was a very even blur among
            all the edges. And they all lived happily ever after :)

2)

experiment: brushes.png with pulse.filt
output:     brushes_pulse.png
result:     Seemed to blur the image and add some noise to it as well

experiment: brushes.png with tent.filt
output:     brushes_tent.png
result:     It blurred the image slightly

experiment: brushes.png with hp.filt
output:     brushes_hp.png
result:     This filter highlighted the edges of the image

experiment: brushes.png with sobol-horiz.filt
output:     brushes_sobol-horiz.png
result:     Highlighted the vertical lines in the image

experiment: brushes.png with sobol-vert.filt
output:     brushes_sobol-vert.png
result:     Highlighted the horizontal lines in the image


3)

experiment: brushes.png with myfilt1.filt
output:     myfilt1.png
result:     Sharpened the image and darkened it.

experiment: brushes.png with myfilt2.filt
output:     myfilt2.png
result:
